<h1> WSU GLEAM Team </h1>
A repository to store and share code among a team of WSU (Winona State University) Undergraduate Students on 2 teams participating in the MNSGC (Minnesota Space Grant Conortium) GLEAM Lunar Robotics Challenge. 
<br><br>
The Challenge: "Teams of students will develop small electronic sensor suites which will be carried by miniature radio-controlled surface vehicles to explore an unknown, totally-dark environment"
<br><br>

<br>
The Team:

Maureen Pelissero - Team Lead, Sensors
Stephen Shaw - Team Technical Lead, Electronic Systems
Morgan Mumm - Mechanical Systems
Himanshu Bhushan - Communications and Data Visualization
Mati Nemera - Communications and Data Visualization
<br>

The Team's solution:

1 Rover (EV or exploration Vehicle), HB or Home Base, and a CU or Central Unit operating as a wifi access point to channel all communications between HB and the EV. See file directories for python code developed, electrical/mechanical schematics, and the final solution.
